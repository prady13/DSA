Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]


class Solution 
{
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) 
    {
        if (head == null)  //Base case
        {
            return null;
        }
        ListNode current = head;    //Initialize a pointer

        while (current != null && current.next != null)      // Loop until we reach the end of the list
        {
            if(current.val == current.next.val)      // Check if the current value is the same as the next value
            {
                current.next = current.next.next;    // SKIP the next node because it's a duplicate. We change the pointer to point to the node AFTER the next one
            }
            else
            {
                current = current.next;    // If they are different, just move forward normally.
            }
        }
        return head;
    }
}
