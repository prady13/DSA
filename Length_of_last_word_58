Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.


class Solution 
{
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) 
    {
        int i = s.length() - 1;        // Start at the very last index of the string
        int length = 0;

        while (i >= 0 && s.charAt(i) == ' ')      // 1. Skip all spaces at the end of the string
                                                  // Example: "Hello World  " -> moves pointer 'i' to the 'd' in World
        {
            i--;
        }
        while (i >= 0 && s.charAt(i) != ' ')      // 2. Now that we are at the last character of the word, 
                                                  // start counting until we hit a space or the start of the string
        {
            length++;                        // Increment our count for each character
            i--;                             // Move the pointer to the left
        }
        return length;
    }
}
