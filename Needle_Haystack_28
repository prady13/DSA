Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.


--> Start at index 0.

--> Extract a substring from the haystack that is the same length as the needle.

--> Compare:
If they match, you found it! Return the current index.
If not, slide the window one step to the right.

--> Stop when the window hits the end of the haystack.


class Solution 
{
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) 
    {
        int hlen = haystack.length();
        int nlen = needle.length();

        for (int i = 0; i<=hlen - nlen; i++)        // Iterate only until there is enough room left for the needle
        {
            if(haystack.substring(i, i + nlen).equals(needle))      // Create a window of text from i to (i + length of needle)
            {
                return i;      //Found
            }
        }
        return -1;             //Not found
    }
}
