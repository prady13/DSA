You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

Example 1:

Input: digits = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
Example 2:

Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].
Example 3:

Input: digits = [9]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be [1,0].

    public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) 
    {
        for (int i = digits.length - 1; i>=0; i--)            // 1. Start from the last digit (rightmost) and move towards the front
        {
            if (digits[i]<9)            // 2. If the current digit is less than 9, we can just increment and finish                                
            {
                digits[i]++;
                return digits;
            }
            digits[i]=0;                // 3. If the digit was 9, it becomes 0 (carrying the 1 to the next iteration)
        }
        int[] newNumber = new int[digits.length + 1];       // 4. If we reach this point, it means the number was all 9s (e.g., 999) 
        newNumber[0] = 1;                                    // We need a new array with one extra space (e.g., 1000)

        return newNumber;            // The new array is initialized to all 0s by default in Java, 
                                    // so we just need to set the first digit to 1.
    }
}
